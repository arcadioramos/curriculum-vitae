## Hello there, if you wanna use it to deploy your own CV follow the next steps: 

- Once you have all the app customized as you wanted in the package.json change the homepage to: "http://yourusername.github.io/"
- Push all your changes to your repo
- run npm run deploy, even if you have yarn run it as npm.
- if everything worked you will have a new branch on your repo called gh-pages
- go to settings part on your repo, pages and you will have your URL to your web app.
